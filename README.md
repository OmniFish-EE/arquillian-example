# arquillian-example
Shows a minimal example of an maven/junit/arquillian test

In this example we use Arquillian just to start and stop GlassFish and deploy and undeploy the actual war that the Maven build
created.

The test code itself is a fully functional standalone application, that can be deployed, debugged, tested, etc without using
the test framework.
